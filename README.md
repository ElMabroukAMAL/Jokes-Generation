## Project Overview 

Developed a web application using `FastAPI` to generate jokes on user-specified topics:

- Employed `LangChain` and Google's Generative AI (`gemini-1.5-pro`) for joke generation.
- Configured prompts to request jokes on specific subjects.
- Processed user inputs and returned generated jokes in JSON format through the FastAPI interface.
